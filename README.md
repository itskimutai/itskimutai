Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm an intermediate Python developer with experience building web applications, data analysis tools, and automation scripts. I have a goodfoundation in computer science principles and am constantly looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. Some of the technologies I've worked with include Flask, NumPy, and Pandas. Feel free to take a look at my projects to see some examples of my work, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions.</hr>
